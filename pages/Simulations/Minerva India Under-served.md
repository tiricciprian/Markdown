#### **Description**


_This report simulates the fund's performance from various hypothetical starting points to provide deeper insight into its risk-adjusted performance. We employ a range of visualization techniques and metrics, including histograms, box plots, cartesian plots, distributions, and data tables for cluster and MPT (Modern Portfolio Theory) analysis._

_The fund simulations has delivered average positive annualized excess returns across the simulations. Another positive aspect was its marginally better outliers performance, as illustrated in the Information Ratio analytics. Even MPT statistics suggest a higher average Information Ratio and a relatively lower Maximum Drawdown. The only negative was the Cluster Analysis, where the fund simulations underperformed the S&P BSE Small Cap benchmark in terms of both return and risk._
